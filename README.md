# 2016 Olympics Predictions - Who will win a medal?

# Project Overview:
Based on athlete data from the Olympic games between 1896-2014, we created a  machine learning model to predict who would win a medal in the RIO 2016 Olympic Games. 

We are using Amazon Web Services S3 to host our Olympic athlete's dataset from Kaggle.
